# Smart-Office-Monitoring-Indoor-Air-Quality-with-Arduino
Indoor Air Quality Monitoring or Testing (IAQ) is an essential process to determine the level of contaminants present in indoor air which can affect the productivity & well-being of occupants. Good and healthy Air Quality at the workplace can increase workers’ comfort, productivity, and well-being. The main objective of this project is to devise a simple low-cost Arduino-based air pollution monitoring system using wireless technology that finds the presence of various gases like CO2, CO, and NH3 and it can also detect the presence of alcohol, smog, LPG gas, and parameters like humidity, temperature, etc. We can also use these projects as LPG detectors, alcohol detectors, smog detectors, etc. We can use this project in our homes, universities, community kitchens, offices, and villages. To create a tool that will monitor the quality of air in our environment, the content of different gases present in the air or area around us, and display the data on LCD.
